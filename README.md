# CurrencyEdittext
Android edittext currency mask library.

By inserting additional properties into the  [BlacKCaT27](https://github.com/BlacKCaT27/CurrencyEditText) library, the cursor remains fixed, and the cursor will no longer return to the beginning. The cursor will continue to stay where it is until you change it.

The cursor will move to decimal part when you click to comma.
